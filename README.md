How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Testing is essential to writing reliable software. To ensure my code functions correctly, I create and run unit tests for each core method to validate behavior against expected results. I incorporate these tests into a CI pipeline so they run automatically and flag any breaking changes. This allows me to catch issues early and keep my build stable. For security, I follow best practices such as input validation and limiting data exposure. I also pay attention to exception handling and edge cases to prevent unintended behavior or vulnerabilities.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Understanding user needs starts with effective communication and active listening. I try to clarify the root problems by asking questions using the "5 Whys" method and observing how users interact with similar systems. I also use wireframes or mock-ups to visualize features, which helps bridge the gap between technical design and user expectations. By iterating based on feedback, I make sure that the software addresses real needs instead of assumptions.

How do I approach designing software?

My software design process begins with understanding the requirements, both functional and non-functional. I break the project into manageable components using an object-oriented approach. I prioritize clean, modular code and focus on maintainability. I often sketch out the class structure first, followed by designing key interfaces or services. I build with flexibility in mind so that future changes can be made with minimal disruption. Listening to feedback and adapting quickly are core parts of my design mindset.
